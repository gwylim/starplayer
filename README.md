# \*Star board game AI

This is a Monte-Carlo [\*Star](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/*Star) computer
player. The implementation is largely similar to that described in [this
paper](http://doc.utwente.nl/94138/) on a player for Poly-Y (a similar board
game).

This can be played against online [here](https://gwylim.net/star).
